# Human Activity Recogonition Using Smartphones - KNeighbors Classifier

In this project you will design a robust activity recogonition system based on the smartphones.
As you know mobile devices have accelerometer as the sensor which collects the activities.
These activities can be classified using K-nearest neighbour. 


### REQUIREMENT
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
4. Scikit Learn

 
### Attribute Information:

For each record in the dataset it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
